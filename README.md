# Stars

The purpose of this repository to share the idea of how to structuring the application
in a nice way.
In my opinion, flutter_redux and redux_epics is a great combination to setup base for
flutter application.

Note: You can have a look in [flutter_redux](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_redux),
and [redux_epics](https://pub.dev/packages/redux_epics).

[Nihad Delic](https://nihad-delic91.medium.com) also wrote a small application to understand how to use `flutter_redux`
with `redux_epics` in the following
URL [Redux and epics for better-organized code in Flutter apps](https://nihad-delic91.medium.com/reduce-duplication-achieve-flexibility-means-success-for-the-flutter-app-e5e432839e61)
